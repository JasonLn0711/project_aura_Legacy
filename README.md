## Project Status Update

This Python-based prototype served as the initial proof-of-concept for the AURA system. Development has officially shifted to the Rust ecosystem to leverage strict memory management and high-performance concurrency—essential for our ongoing AI and Cybersecurity research at **National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)**.

> [!WARNING]
> **This project is now End-of-Life (EOL) and no longer maintained.**
> To achieve superior security, higher performance, and memory safety, this project will be migrated to a **Rust** implementation.

## 🆕 What's New in v2.1.0

This version introduces significant stability improvements, batch processing capabilities, and advanced audio pre-processing.

### 🚀 Performance & Stability

* **Asynchronous Model Loading**: Introduced `ModelLoaderThread` to load Whisper models in the background, preventing UI freezes during startup or setting changes.
* **Memory Optimization**: Implemented aggressive garbage collection (`gc.collect()`) and CUDA cache clearing after processing to prevent Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors.
* **Defensive Programming**: Added safety checks (using `hasattr`) in `closeEvent` to ensure the application shuts down cleanly even if threads are in an inconsistent state.

### 🎙️ Audio Processing Enhancements

* **Real-Time Denoising**: Integrated `noisereduce` for spectral subtraction. Users can now toggle denoising to filter out background hums (like fans or AC) before VAD and transcription.
* **Volume Normalization**: Added a dynamic normalization layer that standardizes all audio to a user-defined target dBFS (default -20), ensuring consistent results for quiet or loud speakers.
* **Intelligent VAD Placement**: Denoising is performed *before* Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to improve speech detection accuracy in noisy environments.

### 🛠️ UI & Workflow

* **Batch Transcription**: Now supports multi-file selection with a dedicated queue system and progress bar.
* **Advanced Settings Container**: A new foldable UI section allows customization of `Beam Size`, `Initial Prompt`, `Language`, and `Compute Type` (float16/int8).
* **System Tray Integration**: The application can now minimize to the system tray, allowing long transcription tasks to run in the background without cluttering the taskbar.
* **Auto-Update Checker**: Integrated `UpdateCheckerThread` to notify users of new releases available on GitHub.

| **Batch Transcription** | Import multiple audio/video files with queue scheduling and progress tracking. |
| **Real-Time Denoising** | `noisereduce` integration for spectral subtraction before ASR to ensure clean audio. |
| **Volume Normalization** | Dynamically standardizes imported and recorded audio to a target dBFS (e.g., -20 dBFS). |
| **Asynchronous Architecture** | `ModelLoaderThread` prevents UI freezing during initialization and compute-type switching. |
| **Advanced Memory Management** | Aggressive garbage collection (`gc.collect()`) and CUDA cache clearing to prevent OOM errors. |

## 1. Project Introduction

Taking meeting notes from long recordings is expensive and error-prone. **Project AURA** turns raw audio into structured artifacts with high efficiency.

AURA provides two UI tabs:

- **📝 Recording & Transcription**: Record mic audio, view live waveforms, process batches of files, and manage advanced model settings (Language, Beam Size, Target dBFS, Compute Type).
- **✂️ Smart Splitter**: Choose a file + output folder, pick a target length & tolerance, and export segmented chunks without cutting off sentences.

## 2. Repository Structure

```text
project_aura/
├── project_aura.py             # Main application (UI + ASR + VAD + Splitter + Threads)
├── project_aura_zh.py          # Support for traditional Mandarin UI
├── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
└── README.md                 # This documentation

```

> Note: Large audio outputs, `temp_transcript.txt`, and temporary WAV files are intentionally excluded from Git tracking and are auto-cleaned by the application.

5. **Save**: Save transcripts via **💾 Save transcript (.txt)**.

**Tab 2 — Smart Splitter**

1. Select input file (mp3/wav/m4a/mp4/flac).
2. Select output folder.
3. Set target length (minutes) + tolerance.
4. Click **Start** to export intelligently split audio chunks.

## 7. Troubleshooting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This version is archived.** For any new issues, feature requests, or to experience the more secure and performant implementation, please refer to the **[Aura-RS](https://github.com/JasonLn0711/Aura-RS)** repository. The instructions below are kept for legacy reference only.
 
### 7.1 "Out of Memory" (OOM) Errors on GPU

If the app crashes or throws an OOM error during model load or batch processing:

* Open **Advanced Settings** and change Compute Type to `int8`.
* Ensure no other heavy VRAM applications are running.
* The app now includes aggressive GC and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` to mitigate this between files.

### 7.2 File Bloat in Smart Splitter

If your exported files are larger than the original:

* The app now utilizes `mediainfo` to automatically detect and match the original bitrate instead of forcing 192k. Ensure `ffmpeg` is properly installed on your system.

### 7.3 Mic Device Issues (Linux)

* AURA prioritizes **PulseAudio** devices for automatic resampling. Confirm your system microphone works in system settings and that PulseAudio/PipeWire is active.
